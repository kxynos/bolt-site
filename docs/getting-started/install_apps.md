You can install apps directly from the Pixel, or from the USB menu. Here, we'll describe both ways.

## Installing on-badge
* In the launcher, scroll to the _App Store_ app, and start it.
* The Pixel will [connect to WiFi](/docs/getting-started/wifi), and download the list of apps. If there's no connection, or an error occurs, you go back to the launcher.
* A list of app categories will be shown. Select one with **A**, and it will show the apps in that category. Press **A** to install the selected app, or **B** to go back to the categories.


## Installing via the USB menu
* After [connecting via USB](/docs/getting-started/connecting), go to the _Installer_ option.
* Here you can see the app categories and install apps, just like you would on your badge.
