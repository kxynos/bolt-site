## Powering
You can power your badge via either USB C, or a ([flat-top](/docs/faq/#can-i-use-any-18650-li-ion-battery)) 18650 lithium-ion battery. Its USB does not require USB PD, and you can plug it into any USB 3.0 computer or (phone) charger. If you use a li-ion battery, the positive end should point towards the USB connector. The battery will charge when USB is connected.

<div class="note">
<strong>Important:</strong>
Please be very careful with lithium-ion batteries. The Pixel Badge contains protection circuitry against overcharging, excessive current draw, and undervoltage, but please don't put them to the test.

If you're not using your badge, always disconnect the battery. Don't have a battery in your badge if it's continuously on USB power.
