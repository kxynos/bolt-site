The *mpu6050* module lets you read the accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature sensor data from your Founder's Edition Pixel Badge. Note that the MPU6050 is not present on the older CampZone2019 badge.

## Reference

| Function | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get_accel    |  - | Returns a tuple of (x, y, z) values for the three axes of the accelerometer. |
| get_gyro    | -  | Returns a tuple of (x, y, z) angular velocities around the three axes of the gyroscope. |
| get_temp    |  - | Returns the current temperature of the accelerometer chip. Note that this value is not calibrated, so it's rather a rough estimation. |
